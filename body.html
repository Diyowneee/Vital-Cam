		<h1> Body </h1>
		<p> CCTVs are designed with the needs of users in mind. Depending on the requirements, <br> they can be configured in a variety of ways. The body's primary function is to keep all of <br> the Vital Cam's components in place. It will not work properly without the body because <br> there is nothing to hold them in place. Housing, mainboard, nightvision, IR Cut filter, and <br> Lens are all included. The housing is chosen for its appearance and feel. It could be a <br> dome, bullet, box, or other shape. The housing is also determined by the requisite IP rating. <br> The chipset or CPU of the camera is located on the mainboard. The picture processing is <br> done by this CPU. The image quality is also determined by a sensor on the mainboard. A <br> ring of infrared LED light bulbs is installed in the camera to provide day/night or nightvision. <br> The LEDs are automatically turned on in such dim lighting. Infrared light is invisible to humans; <br> only the camera can see it. Underneath the lens are IR filters. When the camera is set to <br>nightvision, the filter blocks all other light and only allows infrared light to get through. The field <br> of view is then shown in black and white. During the darkness, black and white photos are <br> sharper than color images. Overall, the body is one of the important parts of a CCTV. </p>
